# SPA

A super lightweight framework for building Single Page Applications in pure JavaScript. Bootstrap your idea, mvp, prototype, app or website faster than before.

## Why SPA?

A lot of developers dislike using complex, lumpy and slow dev frameworks like React, Vue and Angular. This SPA framework is a pure JavaScript alternative.
We do use the jQuery library for managing events and HTTP requests, alternatively you can easily replace this by native JS code.

One of the main reasons for dev frameworks like React/Vue/Angualr is that historically JS was not very modular. A lot of front-end JS code was contained in a single file and could grow very large, a pain in the ass for maintenance, development and debugging.

But in recent years with the latest ES6 standard it is possible to build modular JS code, thanks to the import/export functionality which is now supported by all modern browsers. It's no longer necessary to use any of those complicated frameworks for building well designed apps. Using pure JavaScript is now faster and more efficient than ever before for development.

A final major reason many developers use over-complicated frameworks is for handling dynamic page navigations. This is something novice developers may have little knowledge of, but it's actually very easy.
